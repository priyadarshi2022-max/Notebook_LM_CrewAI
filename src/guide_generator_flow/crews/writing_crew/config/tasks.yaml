    RESEARCH REPORT TO TRANSFORM INTO GUIDE:
    {research_report}

    YOUR TASK:
    Create a complete getting-started guide following this EXACT structure:

    # Getting started with [Framework/Tool Name]

    ## INTRODUCTION
      - Explain what this framework/tool is in 2-3 simple sentences.
      - Why beginners should learn it. (benefits, use cases).
      - What readers will learn by the end of this guide.

    ## Prerequisites
      - What knowledge is assumed (if any-explain technical terms).
      - System requirements (OS, Hardware)
      - Software that needs to be installed first.

    ## Installation and Setup
      - Step by Step installation instructions.
      - How to verify if installation is complete.
      - Basic configuration (if needed).

    ## Core concepts
      - 3-5 fundamental concepts beginners MUST understand.
      - Explain each concept with simple analogies
      - Define all technical terminology.
    
    ## Your First [Project/Example]
      - A simple, practical example to get hands-on knowledge.
      - Include complete code with line-by-line explanations.
      - Show the expected output of the code.
      - Explain what's happening at each step.

    ## Common Patterns and Use cases
      - 2-3 typical use cases beginners will encounter.
      - When to use each pattern.
      - Simple examples for each

    ## Troubleshooting
      - Top 5 errors beginners commonly face.
      - How to fix each error (step-by-step).
      - How to recognize these errors.

    ## Next steps
      - What to learn after mastering the basics.
      - Recommend learning path.
      - Links to next-level tutorials

    ## Additional Resources
      - Links to official documentation.
      - Community forums and support.
      - Video tutorials (if mentioned in research)

    CRITICAL WRITING GUIDELINES:
    1. BEGINNER FRIENDLY MINDSET:
      - Assume reader has ZERO experience with this tool.
      - Define every technical term before using it.
      - Use analogies to explain abstract concepts.

    2. CLEAR STRUCTURE:
      - Use markdown headers properly
      - Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
      - Use bullet points and numbered lists.
      - Add emoji or visual markers for important notes.

    3. PRACTICAL AND ACTIONABLE:
      - Every section should have concrete examples.
      - Core examples must be copy-paste ready.
      - Include expected outputs wherever possible.

    4. ENCOURAGE TONE:
      - Use "you" and "we" (friendly, not academic).
      - Acknowledge that learning is a process.
      - Celebrate small wins.

    5. LENGTH:
      - Aim for 3000-5000 words.
      - Better be thorough to save space.

  expected_output: >
    A complete getting started guide in markdown format (3000-5000 words) that:

      - Follows the exact structure specified above.
      - Is written in clean, beginner-friendly language.
      - Includes practical examples along with code snippets.
      - Defines all technical terms.
      - Can be followed step-by-step by someone with zero experience.
