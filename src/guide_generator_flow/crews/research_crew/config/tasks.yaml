    1. YouTube videos/channels:
    {youtube_links}

    2. Web Pages/Articles/Code Documentation:
    {webpage_links}

    3. Research Papers:
    {research_paper_links}

    4. Documents (PDF/Text/Markdown):
    {document_path}

    YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. Identify which source types are provided (non-empty).

      - Arxiv Specialist: for research_paper_links
      - Document Specialist: for document_paths
    3. Collect all the research findings from each of the specialist engaged.
    4. Compile everything into ONE comprehensive research report
      that includes:
        - Executive Summary of all sources.
        - Detailed findings organized by source type.
        - All technical concepts, methods and implementations.
        - Code examples and practical demo. (In proper code blocks)
        - Best practices and tutorials.
        - Step byu step guides and walkthroughs.
        - Any charts or flows described as text.
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
      - Do Not shorten or summarize content - include EVERYTHING discovered.
      - If a source field is empty, skip that source type entirely.

      - The final report generated should be exhaustive (minimum 5000 words).
      - Include complete citations and links for all sources.
